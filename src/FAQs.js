      question: "What is a CSA?",
      answer: `"CSA" stands for "Community Supported Agriculture". Today’s CSAs tend to be a subscription where the customer makes an up-front payment and receives a box of produce each week throughout the growing season (this one is no different).  The first CSAs took place in Japan in response to chemical farming practices. The new iteration we know today in North America took off in the 80s and, although similar, formed independently of the Japanese and is based on Rudolph Steiner's ideas from the 1920s.`,

      question: "Do I have to make the entire payment up front?",
      answer: "Yes for now. Since our costs are up front, it's important to have the payments up front as well. If you really want to join, but can't make the one-time payment. Contact us and we can work something out.",

      question: "I want to join, but I don't think we'll use that much produce. Can I split a share with someone?",
      answer: "Yes, we're offering a half share for the 2025 CSA. Starting at $300, you'll pick up or receive a box every other week. You can choose this option when signing up",

      question: "Do you offer seasonal shares? Spring, Summer, Fall?",
      answer: "While we don't offer seasonal shares at the moment, we have a half share option which is every other week. We may add seasonal shares in the future if there's interest.",

      question: "What if I’m gone for a week and can’t pick up my share?",
      answer: "If you know ahead of time that you'll be absent for a CSA pickup/delivery, please text or email us as soon as you can. As long as we’re aware before harvesting time, you'll be able to receive a double share the following week. This does not, however, carry over for a third week.",

      question: "What if I forget to pick up my share?",
      answer: "We understand that many of our members have chaotic lives and picking up a box of produce might not be of first priority. If you realize you forgot to pick up your share, it will be held for 24 hours, and you can pick it up the next morning. After that, someone will eat it. We don’t keep track of who’s picked up and who hasn’t, so we can’t notify you if you forget.",

      question: "What risk am I taking?",
      answer: `As a CSA member, you are sharing risk, not unlike an investor. You should be aware of what those risks are and how they apply in our case. The good news is we have a pretty risk-free setup compared to other growers. Here’s an overview of **link** and which ones concern us.`,

      question: "Do you have a shop or a way to purchase produce items individually?",
      answer: "Right now (Spring 2025) there is just the CSA Program. That said, we plan to offer produce for purchase at the Whitney Farmstead on a regular basis for the 2025 season, but the CSA is top priority.",

      question: "Is it Organic?",
      answer: "Obtaining Organic certification is a lengthy process and something for a later year. However, we don’t use any products or practices that are prohibited under Organic regulations.",

      question: "What is the history of the land?",
      answer: "This land was conventionally farmed for corn and soy until 2023 when it was planted in perennial hay. Growing vegetables in a heavy clay loam with low organic matter would be miserable at best. Because of this, We’re going HEAVY on compost to add nutrients, improve structure, and bring back the biology required for small scale vegetable production.",
